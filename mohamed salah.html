    <p>Egyptian soccer (association football) player Mohamed Salah’s prolific scoring made him a star of both the English Premier League and the Egyptian national team. As a forward for Liverpool FC, he was voted the Premier League’s player of the season in 2017–18. He was also named the 2017 African Footballer of the Year.</p>
    <p>Salah was born on June 15, 1992, in Basyoun, Egypt, north of Cairo. As a youth, he idolized such professional players as Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane, whose moves he tried to emulate during pickup games. At the age of 14 he joined the Egyptian club El Mokawloon’s youth team. He made his debut with El Mokawloon’s senior team in 2010. Salah’s speed and goal-scoring ability soon caught the attention of Swiss club FC Basel, which signed him to a contract in 2012. He helped lead FC Basel to the Swiss Super League title and an appearance in the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Europa League semifinals in 2012–13. That season he received the Swiss Golden Player award as the Super League’s outstanding player.</p>

    <p>In January 2014 Salah transferred to Chelsea FC of the Premier League. Despite high expectations for Salah, he struggled during his time with Chelsea. He started in only six Premier League matches with the club before being loaned to Fiorentina of Italy’s top league, Serie A, in February 2015. Later that year he was loaned by Chelsea to another Serie A team, AS Roma. Salah’s play dramatically improved after his move to the Italian league. He completed a permanent transfer to AS Roma before the 2016–17 season. He recorded 19 goals and 13 assists that season and was chosen as AS Roma’s player of the year.</p>
    <p>Salah returned to the Premier League in July 2017 after signing to play for Liverpool. He netted an astonishing 32 goals in Premier League matches in 2017–18, setting a new league record for the most goals scored by a player during a single 38-game season. Salah was rewarded with the Golden Boot as the Premier League’s top scorer. That season he also led Liverpool to the UEFA Champions League final, where the team lost to Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid. Salah finished the season with an overall tally of 44 goals in all competitions. In May 2018 he garnered the Premier League’s player of the season award. He was only the third Liverpool player and the first Egyptian to receive that honor. In 2019 he helped Liverpool secure the Champions League title, scoring on an early penalty kick during the team’s 2–0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in the final match. Salah was again Liverpool’s top goal scorer in 2019–20. He made 19 goals and 10 assists that season as the team captured the Premier League title.</p>

<h3>Club Career</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        El Mokawloon (2010–2012)
        <p>Salah’s impressive performances in the Egyptian league caught the attention of European scouts. After a friendly match against FC Basel, where Salah shined, the Swiss club immediately signed him in 2012.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
        Basel (2012–2014)
        <p>At FC Basel, Salah became a key player, helping the team win two Swiss Super League titles. He also gained international recognition after scoring against Chelsea in the UEFA Champions League, which ultimately led to his transfer to the Premier League club in 2014.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Chelsea (2014–2016)
        <p>Salah joined Chelsea under José Mourinho, but he struggled to secure regular playing time due to competition from world-class players. This led to loan spells at Fiorentina and Roma, where he rediscovered his form.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Fiorentina (Loan, 2015)</li>
    <p>In Serie A, Salah quickly adapted, scoring crucial goals and earning a reputation for his speed and dribbling skills. Fiorentina wanted to sign him permanently, but Salah instead moved to AS Roma.</p>
    <li>Roma (2016–2017)</li>
    <p>Salah flourished at AS Roma, scoring 19 goals in the 2016-17 season and leading the team to a second-place finish in Serie A. His performances made him one of the most sought-after wingers in Europe.</p>
    <li>Liverpool (2017–Present)</li>
    <p>In 2017, Liverpool signed Salah for a then-club record fee of €42 million. He had a sensational debut season, scoring 44 goals in all competitions, winning the Premier League Golden Boot, and leading Liverpool to the UEFA Champions League final. </p>
</ol>
<p>Salah remains Liverpool’s most important player, consistently delivering goals and assists while breaking records season after season.</p>
